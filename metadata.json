    "Title": "Morgan fingerprints in binary form (radius 3, 2048 dimensions)",
    "Description": "The Morgan Fingerprints are one of the most widely used molecular representations. They are circular representations (from an atom,search the atoms around with a radius n) and can have thousands of features. This implementation uses the RDKit package and is done with radius 3 and 2048 dimensions, providing a binary vector as output. For Morgan counts, see model eos5axz.",
